# Sum of Positive Numbers

A program to calculate the sum of all positive numbers from a user-defined series of inputs.

## üìù Description

This program first prompts the user for a number, `n`, which specifies how many integers will be entered subsequently. It then reads `n` numbers one by one. The program identifies all the strictly positive numbers (greater than zero) from the list and calculates their total sum.

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Input:

  * The first input is a single positive integer (`n`).
  * The next `n` inputs are the integers to be evaluated.

### Output:

  * The total sum of all positive numbers entered.
  * "NotProceed" if the first input `n` is not a positive integer or not an integer at all.

### Rules:

1.  The first input **n** (the count of numbers to follow) must be a **positive integer**.
2.  If `n` is zero, negative, or a non-integer, the program should output the message **"NotProceed"**.
3.  The program will then read `n` integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero.
4.  The program must only sum the numbers that are strictly greater than 0.
5.  The final output should be the sum of only these positive numbers.

## üí° Examples

### Example 1 (n = 3)

**Input:**

```
3
-1
2
1
```

**Output:**

```
3
```

**Explanation:** Out of the numbers `-1`, `2`, `1`, the positive ones are `2` and `1`. The sum is **3**.

### Example 2 (n = 3)

**Input:**

```
3
1
3
5
```

**Output:**

```
9
```

**Explanation:** The positive numbers are `1`, `3`, and `5`. The sum is **9**.

### Example 3 (n = 1)

**Input:**

```
1
-5
```

**Output:**

```
0
```

**Explanation:** There are no positive numbers in the input list. The sum is **0**.

### Example 4 (n = -5)

**Input:**

```
-5
```

**Output:**

```
NotProceed
```

**Explanation:** The first input `n` is negative, which is not a valid count.

### Example 5 (n = 1.6)

**Input:**

```
1.6
```

**Output:**

```
NotProceed
```

**Explanation:** The first input `n` is not an integer.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone this repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adiaryaz/sum-of-positives.git
    cd sum-of-positives
    ```

2.  **Run the program** (assuming the file is `main.py`):

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Enter the count `n` first, then enter `n` integers to see the result.
